# Documentation Update - Workflow Integration

**Date**: 2024-12-19
**Task**: Updated all documentation files to reflect current project status and integrate documentation workflow rules

## Changes
- Updated `development-plan.md` with current progress (85% backend, 90% infrastructure)
- Updated `api-specification.md` to reflect completed API deployment
- Updated `backend-guide.md` with completed Lambda implementations and testing
- Updated `frontend-guide.md` with priority tasks and workflow integration
- Updated `task-list.md` with accurate completion percentages
- Updated `terminology.md` with documentation workflow terms
- Added documentation workflow headers to all major docs

## Decisions
- Integrated documentation workflow rules into all existing documentation
- Updated progress percentages to reflect actual completion status
- Added workflow compliance headers to ensure rule adherence
- Established consistent documentation update pattern

## Files Affected
- `docs/development-plan.md` (updated progress and priorities)
- `docs/api-specification.md` (updated implementation status)
- `docs/backend-guide.md` (updated completion status)
- `docs/frontend-guide.md` (added workflow integration)
- `docs/task-list.md` (updated progress percentages)
- `docs/terminology.md` (added documentation terms)
- `docs/log/2024-12-19-docs-update-workflow-integration.md` (new)

## Notes
All documentation now reflects the actual project status where backend APIs are complete and deployed, but frontend integration is the next priority. Documentation workflow rules are now integrated into all major documentation files.
